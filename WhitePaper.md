### Executive Overview

Fee structures can now be embedded in code and “enforced” by the blockchain, reducing audit, compliance, and other operational costs.

SPARK token is an asset-backed and blockchain-traded token. SPARK was initially pre-mined on the BitShares blockchain in 2017 by Ben Bird.

SPARK tokens may be traded (e.g. bought and sold) via the BitShares blockchain system. The BitShares Decentralized Exchange (DEX) is the preferred venue for market activity in SPARK tokens due to low latency confirmation and other technical and systemic considerations.

Each SPARK represents an interest in the asset portfolio of the SPARK fund.

With the awareness that market liquidity affects prices, the goal is to achieve enough liquidity that the market value ultimately approaches the net asset value (NAV) of the SPARK fund. 

Ultimately, like many things in life, the value of SPARK tokens will depend upon what someone is willing to pay to buy one. It is to be expected that the market price will fluctuate and perhaps wildly. 

Ben Bird and his team are working to increase the value of the SPARK fund so that there is always an asset-backed value to SPARK tokens regardless of the prevailing market price at any given time.

### Business Development 

Whether you call it asset development or business development won't really matter once both concepts converge further, but in the meantime SPARK fund has a mission to invest and make trade in digital assets to achieve appreciation in the value of the fund. 

Digital assets such as Bitcoins, BitShares, and other crypto-related digital objects provide opportunities to capitalise on prevailing market prices at any given time due to the open mandate for SPARK fund asset development. 


### Fees

Appreciation of the value of the SPARK fund is subject to a twenty percent participation fee against redemption. 

Each SPARK is subject to redemption by the issuer at any time in exchange for net interest in SPARK fund minus participation and any other applicable fees.

The good news about digital assets is that fees can be quite low when compared to established physical processes such as asset transfer and money transfer e.g. remittance.


### Open Market Participation

SPARK may be exchanged via the BitShares DEX exchange; just be careful of imposter coins because, for the most part, our holders of SPARK are not interested in selling. They are more interested in the next upcoming redemption.

So most of the time, there isn’t any SPARK available to buy, but this is natural for startups with emerging technologies. And so the team is working to provide more liquidity that should enable more market-making activity for SPARK in the future.

This document is neither an offer to sell, nor a solicition of offers to buy, SPARK tokens.


### Issuer Participation

You should be an Accredited Investor or Qualifed Investor as such terms are specified by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission regulations to be in order to buy SPARK tokens from its issuer. 

In other words, the issuer of SPARK is only interested in taking investment from Accredited Investors and Qualifed Investors at this time. This is hoped to change in the future to provide more investment opportunity and more liquidity.
